            <h2 class="heading">CONFIDENCE THROUGH COMPETITION</h2>
            <time datetime="2017-11-23">23 NOVEMBER 2017</time>
            <p>
                I recently took an opportunity to compete at a local competition. Although I have been
                avoiding competition, something inside me knew it had to be done. Through nervousness
                and fear I resisted competition until October the 22nd. Even though I lost both my matches,
                that day would change my life forever.My team, my friends,
                my family and my coach showed mad support. Conquereing the fear and anxiety of competition
                permiated through my entire soul and squashed so many other anxieties I experience daily
                that I had no control over. The most important lesson of that competition was recognizing my
                anxiety and being able to control it. I have increased my self confidence in high stress
                situations, this is an invaluable skill. Not only would I recommend competition but I encourage
                it. Gain confidence through competition.<br>

            <h2 class="heading">TRAINING WHILE INJURED</h2>
            <time datetime="2017-11-24">24 NOVEMBER 2017</time>
            <p>
                During my competition on October the 22nd I sprained my thumb. The importance of rest
                should not be under estimated. That doesn't mean you should stop training. To be clear
                I don't necissarily mean drilling/rolling/instruction until you can protect your injury
                adaquetly. While taking time off the mats I was still training for Jiu Jitsu through
                other mediums that exist off the mat that directly affect your performance. This led me
                to practicing yoga so much so that I continue to do it to this day now that my injust is mostly
                healed and I am training as usual. My flexability and mobility are far greater than prior to my injury.
                Take some time to review old techniques. Othen time I will write down a self explaniation of a 
                techinque I learned inside a journal. When I re-read techniques I pop them back out on the mat
                and refresh the technique in my mind. If you can not train new techniques, mentally retrain old
                techniques as I just described. Make your downtime work for you. Many of the athletes show up to
                class just to watch, this is sometimes enough to keep you resting while still entertaining your
                Jiu Jitsu mind.<br>

            <h2 class="heading">RESPECT YOUR INJURY</h2>
            <time datetime="2017-11-24">25 NOVEMBER 2017</time>
            <p>
                Tap early and tap often is even more prevelent when your body is comprimised.
                Remind yourself every roll that you are going to protect your injury first.
                Let your opponent know whats up with whatever you are protecting. It will
                challenge them to attack something else and it will challenge yourself to protect
                that something else all while keeping your injury away from harm. Don't block a choke
                with an injured hand, its not worth the damage. 
                No one is going to care if they passed your guard or not when you're stepping off the
                mat because you disrispected your injury trying to defend. If its broke its
                broke. Respect your injury.<br>
