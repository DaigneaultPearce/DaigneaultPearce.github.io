            <h2 class="heading">CONFIDENCE THROUGH COMPETITION</h2>
            <time datetime="2017-11-23">23 NOVEMBER 2017</time>
            <p>
                I recently took an opportunity to compete at a local competition. Although I have been
                avoiding competition, something inside me knew it had to be done. Through nervousness
                and fear I resisted competition untill October the 22nd. That day would change my life
                even though lost both of my matches; that was not important to me. My team, my friends,
                my family and my coach showed mad support. Conquereing the fear and anxiety of competition
                permiated through my entire soul and squashed so many other anxieties I experience daily
                that I had no control over. The most important lesson of that competition was recognizing my
                anxiety and being able to control it. I have increased my self confidence in high stress
                situations, this is an invaluable skill. Not only would I recommend competition buy I encourage
                it.
